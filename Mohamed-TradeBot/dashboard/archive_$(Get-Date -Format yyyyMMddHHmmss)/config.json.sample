/*
Alternative: direct DynamoDB access from the browser (no Lambda).
Example config when using direct DynamoDB reads via Cognito Identity Pool:

{
  "dynamodb": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "tableName": "tradebot_table",
    "identityPoolId": "us-east-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}

Notes:
- Ensure the Cognito Identity Pool has an unauthenticated role or properly-authenticated role
  with least-privilege permissions to call dynamodb:Scan or Query on the table.
- This approach removes the need for a Lambda/HTTP API and is cost-effective for low reads.
 
Example minimal IAM policy for the Cognito role (attach to the role used by the Identity Pool):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["dynamodb:Scan", "dynamodb:Query", "dynamodb:GetItem"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:table/tradebot_table"
    }
  ]
}
