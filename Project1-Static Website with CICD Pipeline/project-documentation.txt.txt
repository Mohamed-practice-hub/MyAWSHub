Phase 1: Create Your Website Content

Step 1: Prepare Your Website Files
Create a simple portfolio website with these files:
1. Create 
Index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <h1>Your Name</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

Phase 2: Set Up GitHub Repository
Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1.	Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2.	Click "New repository"
3.	Repository name: aws-portfolio-web-app
4.	Description: My portfolio website hosted on AWS
5.	Make it Public
6.	Initialize with README
7.	Click "Create repository"
Step 3: Upload Your Files
1.	Click "uploading an existing file"
2.	Drag and drop your index.html, styles.css, and error.html
3.	Commit message: Initial website files
4.	Click "Commit changes"
________________________________________
Phase 3: Create S3 Bucket for Website Hosting
Step 4: Create S3 Bucket
1.	Sign in to AWS Console
2.	Go to S3 service
3.	Click "Create bucket"
Bucket Configuration:
•	Bucket name: your-name-portfolio-website (project1-aws-portfolio-website)
 (must be globally unique)
•	Region: us-east-1
 (cheapest for CloudFront)
•	Uncheck "Block all public access"
•	Acknowledge the warning
•	Click "Create bucket"
Step 5: Configure Static Website Hosting
1.	Click on your bucket name
2.	Go to "Properties" tab
3.	Scroll to "Static website hosting"
 
4.	Click "Edit"
5.	Select "Enable"
6.	Index document: index.html
7.	Error document: error.html
8.	Click "Save changes"
9.	Note the website endpoint URL (you'll need this later) -> http://project1-aws-portfolio-website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
Step 6: Set Bucket Policy for Public Access
1.	Go to "Permissions" tab
2.	Click "Bucket policy"
3.	Paste this policy (replace bucket name)

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}


4.	Click "Save changes"
Step 7: Upload Website Files
1.	Go to "Objects" tab
2.	Click "Upload"
3.	Add your files: 
index.html, styles.css, error.html
4.	Click "Upload"
5.	Test your website using the S3 website endpoint URL
http://project1-aws-portfolio-website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
If files not present,
 

S3 static websites will work only for static websites, for https, cloud front must be configured.


________________________________________
Phase 4: Set Up CloudFront Distribution
Step 8: Create CloudFront Distribution
1.	Go to CloudFront service
2.	Click "Create distribution"
Origin Settings:
•	Origin domain: Use your S3 website endpoint (not the bucket name)
o	Example: project1-aws-portfolio-website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
mohamed-portfolio-website.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com - Bucket Endpoint
mohamed-portfolio-website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com - S3 website Endpoint (to be used as the s3 is enabled for static website hosting)

•	Protocol: HTTP only (S3 website endpoints don't support HTTPS)
Default Cache Behavior:
•	Viewer Protocol Policy: 
Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
•	Allowed HTTP Methods: 
GET, HEAD
•	Cache Policy: 
Caching Optimized
Settings:
•	Price Class: 
Use all edge locations
 (Free Tier includes 1TB)
•	Default Root Object: 
index.html
3.	Click "Create distribution"
4.	Wait 10-15 minutes for deployment
5.	Note the CloudFront domain name (e.g., d1234abcd.cloudfront.net)
https://d1h5qajn6cztrt.cloudfront.net/ 

This url will show the site. But Amazon Q says, it will show the site only when default route is set as “index.html”
Step 9: Test CloudFront Distribution
1.	Copy the CloudFront domain name 
2.	Open in browser - your website should load with HTTPS
3.	Test error page by visiting a non-existent page


Your Current Infrastructure ✅
•	S3 Bucket: project1-aws-portfolio-website
 (website hosting enabled)
•	CloudFront Distribution: E2WPPNQQHU3K9B
 (HTTPS enabled, deployed)
•	Website URL: https://d1h5qajn6cztrt.cloudfront.net 
Now let's set up CodePipeline and the necessary IAM role to automate deployments from your GitHub repo.
Step 1: Create GitHub Connection
1.1 Set Up CodeConnections
1.	Go to AWS Console → Developer Tools → Settings → Connections (this wont work so use direct connections url -> https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections )
2.	Click Create connection
3.	Provider: GitHub
4.	Connection name: project1-github-connection
5.	Click Connect to GitHub
6.	Authorize AWS and install the AWS app in your GitHub account
7.	Grant access to your portfolio repository
8.	Click Connect
arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:206055866143:connection/d45baf2f-86c9-40bc-abb2-3f4c7d478288 
Step 2: Create IAM Role for CodePipeline
2.1 Create CodePipeline Service Role
1.	Go to IAM → Roles → Create role
2.	Trusted entity type: AWS service
3.	Use case: CodePipeline

You're absolutely right! This is a common issue. CodePipeline might not be available in your region or there could be service availability restrictions. Let me help you with alternative approaches.
1.	Retrieving knowledge
1.	Looking up page context
Perfect! I can see you're in the right place - you're already in the CodeConnections console (
us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections
). The issue is that CodePipeline IS available in us-east-1, but the IAM role creation process has changed.
Current Status & Solution
✅ What's Working:
•	You're in us-east-1 (CodePipeline is fully supported)
•	You're in the CodeConnections console (correct location)
•	CodePipeline IS available in your region
❌ The Issue:
The IAM console has been updated and CodePipeline might not appear in the service list during role creation, but we can work around this.
Updated Solution - 3 Approaches
Approach 1: Create Role First, Then Update Trust Policy
Step 1: Create Basic Role
1.	Go to IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ 
2.	Roles → Create role
3.	Trusted entity type: AWS service
4.	Use case: Select Lambda (we'll change this later)
5.	Click Next
6.	Skip permissions for now → Next
7.	Role name: Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
8.	Create role
Step 2: Update Trust Policy
1.	Find your role: Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
2.	Trust relationships tab → Edit trust policy
3.	Replace the JSON with:
4.	{
5.	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
6.	    "Statement": [
7.	        {
8.	            "Effect": "Allow",
9.	            "Principal": {
10.	                "Service": [
11.	                    "lambda.amazonaws.com",
12.	                    "codepipeline.amazonaws.com"
13.	                ]
14.	            },
15.	            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
16.	        }
17.	    ]
18.	}

4.	Update policy
Step 3: Add Permissions
1.	Permissions tab → Add permissions → Attach policies
2.	Search and attach: AWSCodePipeline_FullAccess
3.	Add permissions → Create inline policy
4.	JSON tab, paste:
5.	{
6.	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
7.	    "Statement": [
8.	        {
9.	            "Effect": "Allow",
10.	            "Action": [
11.	                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
12.	                "s3:GetObject",
13.	                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
14.	                "s3:PutObject",
15.	                "s3:DeleteObject",
16.	                "s3:ListBucket"
17.	            ],
18.	            "Resource": [
19.	                "arn:aws:s3:::project1-aws-portfolio-website",
20.	                "arn:aws:s3:::project1-aws-portfolio-website/*",
21.	                "arn:aws:s3:::codepipeline-us-east-1-*"
22.	            ]
23.	        },
24.	        {
25.	            "Effect": "Allow",
26.	            "Action": [
27.	                "codeconnections:UseConnection"
28.	            ],
29.	            "Resource": "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:*:connection/*"
30.	        },
31.	        {
32.	            "Effect": "Allow",
33.	            "Action": [
34.	                "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"
35.	            ],
36.	            "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudfront::*:distribution/E2WPPNQQHU3K9B"
37.	        }
38.	    ]
39.	}


5.	Policy name: Project1-PortfolioCustomPermissions
6.	Create policy


Step 3: Prepare Your GitHub Repository
3.1 Add buildspec.yml to Your Repository
Create a file called buildspec.yml  in your repository root:
 
For a simple static site (no build process needed):

 

3.2 Commit and Push
git add buildspec.yml

git commit -m "Add buildspec for CodePipeline"

git push origin main

Run in CloudShell
Step 4: Create CodeBuild Project (Optional but Recommended)
4.1 Create CodeBuild Role
1.	IAM → Roles → Create role
2.	Service: CodeBuild
3.	Policies: 
AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess
4.	Role name: 
PortfolioCodeBuildRole
5.	Add inline policy:
{

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

    "Statement": [

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Action": [

                "logs:CreateLogGroup",

                "logs:CreateLogStream",

                "logs:PutLogEvents"

            ],

            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:*:*"

        },

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Action": [

                "s3:GetObject",

                "s3:PutObject"

            ],

            "Resource": [

                "arn:aws:s3:::codepipeline-us-east-1-*",

                "arn:aws:s3:::project1-aws-portfolio-website/*"

            ]

        }

    ]

}

Pipeline not working,
Key Findings:
✅ Service Role: Correct (
Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
)
✅ Connection: Available and configured
✅ Repository: 
Mohamed-practice-hub/aws-portfolio-web-app

❌ Pipeline Type: V2 (should be V1 for free tier)
❌ Permission: Still failing on codeconnections
Solution: Fix the Permission Issue
The role has wildcards but CodePipeline V2 might need more specific permissions. Let's fix this:
Step 1: Update IAM Policy with Specific Connection ARN
1.	Go to IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ 
2.	Roles → 
Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
3.	Permissions tab → Find 
Project1-PortfolioCustomPermissions
 → Edit policy
4.	Replace the entire JSON with this updated version:
5.	{
6.	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
7.	    "Statement": [
8.	        {
9.	            "Effect": "Allow",
10.	            "Action": [
11.	                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
12.	                "s3:GetObject",
13.	                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
14.	                "s3:PutObject",
15.	                "s3:DeleteObject",
16.	                "s3:ListBucket"
17.	            ],
18.	            "Resource": [
19.	                "arn:aws:s3:::project1-aws-portfolio-website",
20.	                "arn:aws:s3:::project1-aws-portfolio-website/*",
21.	                "arn:aws:s3:::codepipeline-us-east-1-*"
22.	            ]
23.	        },
24.	        {
25.	            "Effect": "Allow",
26.	            "Action": [
27.	                "codeconnections:UseConnection",
28.	                "codeconnections:GetConnection"
29.	            ],
30.	            "Resource": [
31.	                "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:206055866143:connection/d45baf2f-86c9-40bc-abb2-3f4c7d478288",
32.	                "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:206055866143:connection/*"
33.	            ]
34.	        },
35.	        {
36.	            "Effect": "Allow",
37.	            "Action": [
38.	                "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"
39.	            ],
40.	            "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudfront::*:distribution/E2WPPNQQHU3K9B"
41.	        }
42.	    ]
43.	}

5.	Save changes
Step 2: Wait and Test
1.	Wait 5 minutes for IAM propagation
2.	Go to your pipeline: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines/project1-portfolio-deployment-pipeline/view 
3.	Click "Release change" to trigger a new execution
Step 3: If Still Failing - Add More Permissions
If the error persists, add these additional permissions to the same policy:
Following is the fix worked.. codeconnections, and codestar both needs to be added
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "codeconnections:UseConnection",
        "codeconnections:GetConnection", 
        "codestar-connections:UseConnection",
        "codestar-connections:GetConnection"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:206055866143:connection/d45baf2f-86c9-40bc-abb2-3f4c7d478288",
        "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:206055866143:connection/d45baf2f-86c9-40bc-abb2-3f4c7d478288",
        "arn:aws:codeconnections:us-east-1:*:connection/*",
        "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:*:connection/*"
    ]
}

 
🎯 The Root Cause Was:
AWS Service Prefix Transition - AWS is transitioning from 
codestar-connections
 to 
codeconnections
, and your pipeline needed both prefixes to work properly.
Before (Broken):
•	❌ Only had 
codeconnections:UseConnection
•	❌ Missing 
codestar-connections:UseConnection
After (Working):
•	✅ Has both 
codeconnections:UseConnection
 AND 
codestar-connections:UseConnection
•	✅ Has both service prefixes in resource ARNs
•	✅ Added 
GetConnection
 permissions for both services
📊 Your Pipeline Status:
✅ Latest Execution: Successfully completed
✅ Source Stage: Successfully pulled from GitHub
✅ Deploy Stage: Successfully deployed to S3
✅ Execution Time: ~8 seconds (very fast!)
✅ Commit: "Add files via upload"
🔑 Key Lesson:
This is a common AWS issue during service transitions. When AWS updates service names, they often maintain backward compatibility by supporting both old and new prefixes. The solution is to include both prefixes in your IAM policies during the transition period.
🚀 What's Next:
Your CI/CD pipeline is now fully functional! Every time you push changes to your GitHub repository 
Mohamed-practice-hub/aws-portfolio-web-app
, it will:
1.	Automatically trigger the pipeline
2.	Pull your code from GitHub
3.	Deploy to S3 bucket 
project1-aws-portfolio-website
4.	Serve via CloudFront at 
d1h5qajn6cztrt.cloudfront.net
Test it: Make a small change to your website, push to GitHub, and watch it automatically deploy! 🎉
The fix was specifically the dual service prefix permissions - that's what resolved your "insufficient permissions" error.

 


Step 4: Alternative - Recreate Pipeline as V1
Since your pipeline is V2 (which has different permission requirements), let's recreate it as V1:
1.	Delete current pipeline:
o	Pipeline actions → Delete
o	Type pipeline name to confirm
2.	Create new V1 pipeline:
o	Pipeline type: V1 (important!)
o	Service role: 
Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
o	Same source and deploy settings
Quick Test - Try This First:
Before making changes, try this simple fix:
1.	Go to your pipeline
2.	Edit → Edit: Source
3.	Re-select the connection (even though it's already selected)
4.	Save → Save pipeline
5.	Release change
Sometimes re-selecting the connection refreshes the permissions.
Expected Timeline:
•	IAM changes: 5-10 minutes to propagate
•	Pipeline execution: 2-5 minutes
•	Total time: ~15 minutes
Which approach would you like to try first?
1.	Update IAM policy (Step 1)
2.	Quick connection re-selection (Quick Test)
3.	Recreate as V1 pipeline (Step 4)
I recommend starting with the Quick Test first, then the IAM policy update if that doesn't work.




Step 6: Add CloudFront Invalidation (Recommended)
To ensure CloudFront serves updated content immediately:
6.1 Create Lambda Function for Invalidation
1.	Go to Lambda → Create function
2.	Function name: cloudfront-invalidation
3.	Runtime: Python 3.9
 
4.	Code:
5.	import boto3
6.	import json
7.	
8.	def lambda_handler(event, context):
9.	    cloudfront = boto3.client('cloudfront')
10.	    
11.	    # Your CloudFront distribution ID
12.	    distribution_id = 'E2WPPNQQHU3K9B'
13.	    
14.	    try:
15.	        response = cloudfront.create_invalidation(
16.	            DistributionId=distribution_id,
17.	            InvalidationBatch={
18.	                'Paths': {
19.	                    'Quantity': 1,
20.	                    'Items': ['/*']
21.	                },
22.	                'CallerReference': str(context.aws_request_id)
23.	            }
24.	        )
25.	        
26.	        return {
27.	            'statusCode': 200,
28.	            'body': json.dumps('Invalidation created successfully')
29.	        }
30.	    except Exception as e:
31.	        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
32.	        return {
33.	            'statusCode': 500,
34.	            'body': json.dumps(f'Error: {str(e)}')
35.	        }

 
5.	Add CloudFront permissions to Lambda execution role


Step 1: Create Lambda Execution Role with CloudFront Permissions
1.1 Create the IAM Role
1.	Go to IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ 
2.	Roles → Create role
3.	Trusted entity type: AWS service
4.	Use case: Lambda
5.	Click Next
1.2 Attach Basic Lambda Policy
1.	Search for: AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
2.	Check the box to select it
3.	Click Next
1.3 Name and Create Role
1.	Role name: CloudFrontInvalidationLambdaRole
2.	Description: Lambda execution role with CloudFront invalidation permissions
3.	Click Create role

During creaton, cannot add json inline policy, so create the role and then edit
 

1.4 Add CloudFront Permissions
1.	Find your newly created role: 
CloudFrontInvalidationLambdaRole
2.	Click on the role name to open it
3.	Permissions tab → Add permissions → Create inline policy
4.	JSON tab → Paste this policy:
5.	{
6.	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
7.	    "Statement": [
8.	        {
9.	            "Effect": "Allow",
10.	            "Action": [
11.	                "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation",
12.	                "cloudfront:GetInvalidation",
13.	                "cloudfront:ListInvalidations"
14.	            ],
15.	            "Resource": [
16.	                "arn:aws:cloudfront::*:distribution/E2WPPNQQHU3K9B"
17.	            ]
18.	        }
19.	    ]
20.	}

5.	Policy name: CloudFrontInvalidationPolicy
6.	Create policy
1.5 Verify Role Permissions
Your role should now have 2 policies:
•	✅ AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (AWS managed)
•	✅ CloudFrontInvalidationPolicy (Customer managed)
 
Step 2: Create Lambda Function with the Role
2.1 Create Lambda Function
1.	Go to Lambda Console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1 
2.	Create function
3.	Author from scratch
4.	Function name: cloudfront-invalidation
5.	Runtime: Python 3.11
6.	Architecture: x86_64
2.2 Use Existing Role
1.	Change default execution role → Use an existing role
2.	Existing role: Select CloudFrontInvalidationLambdaRole
3.	Create function
2.3 Add Function Code
1.	In the Code tab, replace the default code with:
2.	import boto3
3.	import json
4.	import uuid
5.	import logging
6.	
7.	# Set up logging
8.	logger = logging.getLogger()
9.	logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
10.	
11.	def lambda_handler(event, context):
12.	    """
13.	    Lambda function to invalidate CloudFront distribution cache
14.	    """
15.	    
16.	    # Your CloudFront distribution ID
17.	    distribution_id = 'E2WPPNQQHU3K9B'
18.	    
19.	    # Initialize CloudFront client
20.	    cloudfront = boto3.client('cloudfront')
21.	    
22.	    try:
23.	        logger.info(f"Starting CloudFront invalidation for distribution: {distribution_id}")
24.	        
25.	        # Create invalidation for all files
26.	        response = cloudfront.create_invalidation(
27.	            DistributionId=distribution_id,
28.	            InvalidationBatch={
29.	                'Paths': {
30.	                    'Quantity': 1,
31.	                    'Items': ['/*']  # Invalidate all files
32.	                },
33.	                'CallerReference': str(uuid.uuid4())  # Unique reference ID
34.	            }
35.	        )
36.	        
37.	        invalidation_id = response['Invalidation']['Id']
38.	        logger.info(f"CloudFront invalidation created successfully: {invalidation_id}")
39.	        
40.	        return {
41.	            'statusCode': 200,
42.	            'body': json.dumps({
43.	                'message': 'CloudFront invalidation created successfully',
44.	                'invalidationId': invalidation_id,
45.	                'distributionId': distribution_id,
46.	                'status': response['Invalidation']['Status']
47.	            })
48.	        }
49.	        
50.	    except Exception as e:
51.	        error_message = f"Error creating CloudFront invalidation: {str(e)}"
52.	        logger.error(error_message)
53.	        
54.	        return {
55.	            'statusCode': 500,
56.	            'body': json.dumps({
57.	                'error': error_message,
58.	                'distributionId': distribution_id
59.	            })
60.	        }

2.	Deploy the function (Ctrl+S or click Deploy)
Step 3: Test the Lambda Function
3.1 Create Test Event
1.	Test tab → Create new event
2.	Event name: test-invalidation
3.	Template: hello-world (default is fine)
4.	Save
3.2 Run Test
1.	Click Test
2.	Check the results:
o	✅ Status: Should show "Succeeded"
o	✅ Response: Should show status 200 with invalidation ID
o	✅ Logs: Should show "CloudFront invalidation created successfully"
3.3 Verify in CloudFront Console
1.	Go to CloudFront Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ 
2.	Click on your distribution: E2WPPNQQHU3K9B
3.	Invalidations tab
4.	You should see a new invalidation with status "In Progress" or "Completed"
Step 4: Configure Function Settings (Optional)
4.1 Adjust Timeout
1.	Configuration tab → General configuration → Edit
2.	Timeout: Change to 30 seconds (CloudFront invalidation can take time)
3.	Save
4.2 Add Environment Variables (Optional)
1.	Configuration tab → Environment variables → Edit
2.	Add environment variable:
o	Key: 
DISTRIBUTION_ID
o	Value: 
E2WPPNQQHU3K9B
3.	Save
If you add environment variables, update your code to use them:
import os



# Get distribution ID from environment variable

distribution_id = os.environ.get('DISTRIBUTION_ID', 'E2WPPNQQHU3K9B')

Step 5: Integration Options
Now you can integrate this Lambda function in several ways:
Option A: Add to CodePipeline
•	Add Lambda stage after S3 deploy
•	Automatically invalidate after each deployment
Option B: S3 Event Trigger
•	Trigger Lambda when files are uploaded to S3
•	Automatic invalidation on any S3 change
Option C: Manual Trigger
•	Keep as standalone function
•	Trigger manually when needed

6.2 Add Lambda Stage to Pipeline
1.	Edit your pipeline
2.	Add stage after Deploy
3.	Action provider: AWS Lambda
4.	Function name: cloudfront-invalidation


when i setup stage for pipeline, adding lambda, why is that forcing me to select input artifact, i am choosing lambda serv9ce and function name, isnt that enough, why we need inlupt artifact, while lamda has code in the funtion itself?
Excellent question! You're absolutely right to be confused about this. Let me explain why CodePipeline is asking for input artifacts and how to handle it properly.
Why CodePipeline Asks for Input Artifacts
The Reason:
CodePipeline is designed as a data flow system where each stage passes artifacts (files/data) to the next stage. Even though your Lambda function doesn't need the source code files, CodePipeline's architecture requires you to specify input artifacts for consistency.
What Happens:
•	CodePipeline passes the artifact to Lambda as part of the event
•	Your Lambda function can ignore the artifact completely
•	The artifact data is available in the 
event
 parameter if needed
How to Handle Input Artifacts for Lambda
Option 1: Use Source Artifact (Recommended)
1.	Input artifacts: Select 
SourceOutput
 (or whatever your source stage outputs)
2.	Why this works:
o	✅ Satisfies CodePipeline's requirement
o	✅ Your Lambda function ignores it
o	✅ Pipeline flows correctly
Option 2: Modify Lambda to Handle Pipeline Events
If you want to be more sophisticated, you can modify your Lambda to detect if it's called from CodePipeline:
import boto3

import json

import uuid

import logging



logger = logging.getLogger()

logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)



def lambda_handler(event, context):

    """

    Lambda function to invalidate CloudFront distribution cache

    Works with both manual triggers and CodePipeline

    """

    

    distribution_id = 'E2WPPNQQHU3K9B'

    cloudfront = boto3.client('cloudfront')

    

    # Check if called from CodePipeline

    codepipeline_job_id = None

    if 'CodePipeline.job' in event:

        codepipeline_job_id = event['CodePipeline.job']['id']

        logger.info(f"Called from CodePipeline, Job ID: {codepipeline_job_id}")

        

        # Initialize CodePipeline client for success/failure reporting

        codepipeline = boto3.client('codepipeline')

    

    try:

        logger.info(f"Starting CloudFront invalidation for distribution: {distribution_id}")

        

        # Create invalidation

        response = cloudfront.create_invalidation(

            DistributionId=distribution_id,

            InvalidationBatch={

                'Paths': {

                    'Quantity': 1,

                    'Items': ['/*']

                },

                'CallerReference': str(uuid.uuid4())

            }

        )

        

        invalidation_id = response['Invalidation']['Id']

        logger.info(f"CloudFront invalidation created successfully: {invalidation_id}")

        

        # If called from CodePipeline, report success

        if codepipeline_job_id:

            codepipeline.put_job_success_result(jobId=codepipeline_job_id)

            logger.info("Reported success to CodePipeline")

        

        return {

            'statusCode': 200,

            'body': json.dumps({

                'message': 'CloudFront invalidation created successfully',

                'invalidationId': invalidation_id,

                'distributionId': distribution_id

            })

        }

        

    except Exception as e:

        error_message = f"Error creating CloudFront invalidation: {str(e)}"

        logger.error(error_message)

        

        # If called from CodePipeline, report failure

        if codepipeline_job_id:

            codepipeline.put_job_failure_result(

                jobId=codepipeline_job_id,

                failureDetails={'message': error_message, 'type': 'JobFailed'}

            )

            logger.error("Reported failure to CodePipeline")

        

        return {

            'statusCode': 500,

            'body': json.dumps({'error': error_message})

        }

Option 3: Add CodePipeline Permissions to Lambda Role
If you use the enhanced Lambda code above, add CodePipeline permissions to your Lambda role:
1.	IAM Console → Roles → 
CloudFrontInvalidationLambdaRole
2.	Add permissions → Create inline policy:
{

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

    "Statement": [

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Action": [

                "codepipeline:PutJobSuccessResult",

                "codepipeline:PutJobFailureResult"

            ],

            "Resource": "*"

        }

    ]

}

Step-by-Step: Add Lambda Stage to Pipeline
1. Edit Your Pipeline
1.	CodePipeline Console → Your pipeline → Edit
2.	Add stage (after Deploy stage)
3.	Stage name: 
InvalidateCache
2. Add Lambda Action
1.	Add action group
2.	Action name: 
InvalidateCloudFront
3.	Action provider: AWS Lambda
4.	Region: US East (N. Virginia)
5.	Input artifacts: 
SourceOutput
 ← This is required but ignored
6.	Function name: 
cloudfront-invalidation
7.	User parameters: Leave empty
8.	Variable namespace: Leave empty
9.	Output artifacts: Leave empty
3. Save Pipeline
1.	Done → Save
2.	Save to confirm changes
Why This Design Makes Sense
CodePipeline Philosophy:
•	Consistent Interface: Every action has inputs/outputs
•	Artifact Tracking: Pipeline tracks what flows where
•	Debugging: You can see what data each stage received
•	Flexibility: Lambda could use the artifact if needed later
Real-World Example:
Source Stage → Build Stage → Deploy Stage → Lambda Stage

     ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓

  SourceCode → CompiledCode → DeployedFiles → (Ignores input)

Alternative: S3 Event Trigger (Simpler)
If you find the CodePipeline artifact requirement annoying, consider using S3 Event Trigger instead:
Pros:
•	✅ No artifacts needed
•	✅ Automatic on any S3 change
•	✅ Simpler setup
•	✅ Works even with manual S3 uploads
Setup:
1.	Lambda Console → Your function → Add trigger
2.	S3 → Bucket: 
project1-aws-portfolio-website
3.	Event type: All object create events
4.	Done
Recommendation
For your use case, I recommend:
1.	Use 
SourceOutput
 as input artifact (just select it and ignore it)
2.	Keep your simple Lambda code (no CodePipeline integration needed)
3.	The pipeline will work perfectly - Lambda will invalidate CloudFront regardless of the input artifact
The input artifact is just a CodePipeline requirement - your Lambda function will work exactly as expected!
Would you like me to walk you through adding the Lambda stage with the 
SourceOutput
 artifact selection?



Step 7: Test Your Pipeline

 

🎯 CodePipeline Role Structure
One Service Role Per Pipeline
•	❌ Cannot have multiple service roles on the same pipeline
•	✅ Must update the existing role with additional permissions
•	✅ One role handles all pipeline actions (Source, Deploy, Lambda, etc.)


i added lambda funtion to invalidate CF and getting error: The provided role does not have the lambda:InvokeFunction permission., does CF needs permission to execute lamda function, CF no execution any lambda right, its lamda who calles CF invaldation and it has that permission already. OR is pipeline needs lambda execution permission?
Great question! You're absolutely correct in your understanding. Let me clarify what's happening:
🎯 The Issue: CodePipeline Needs Lambda Permission
You're right:
•	✅ CloudFront doesn't execute Lambda - Lambda calls CloudFront
•	✅ Lambda has CloudFront permissions - that's working fine
•	❌ CodePipeline needs permission to invoke Lambda - this is what's missing!
The Flow:
CodePipeline → Invokes → Lambda Function → Calls → CloudFront Invalidation

     ❌              ✅                    ✅

   Missing         Has Permission      Has Permission

  Permission

Solution: Add Lambda Invoke Permission to CodePipeline Role
Step 1: Go to CodePipeline Service Role
1.	IAM Console → Roles → 
Project1-PortfolioCodePipelineRole
2.	Permissions tab → Add permissions → Create inline policy
Step 2: Add Lambda Invoke Permission
JSON Policy:
 

Step 3: Save Policy
1.	Policy name: LambdaInvokePolicy
2.	Create policy
Alternative: Add to Existing Custom Policy
If you want to add it to your existing custom policy instead:
1.	Find: 
Project1-PortfolioCustomPermissions
 policy
2.	Edit policy
3.	Add this statement to the existing JSON:



Why This Permission is Needed
Permission Chain:
1.	CodePipeline Service Role needs 
lambda:InvokeFunction
 to call Lambda
2.	Lambda Execution Role needs 
cloudfront:CreateInvalidation
 to invalidate cache
3.	Lambda Execution Role needs 
logs:CreateLogGroup
, 
logs:CreateLogStream
, 
logs:PutLogEvents
 for logging
Each Service Needs Different Permissions:
•	CodePipeline Role: Invoke Lambda, Access S3, Use Connections
•	Lambda Role: Call CloudFront, Write Logs
•	CloudFront: No additional permissions needed (it's the target service)
Test After Adding Permission
Step 1: Wait for IAM Propagation
•	Wait 5 minutes after adding the policy
Step 2: Test Pipeline
1.	Go to your pipeline
2.	Release change to trigger execution
3.	Watch the Lambda stage - it should now succeed
Step 3: Verify CloudFront Invalidation
1.	CloudFront Console → Your distribution → Invalidations
2.	You should see a new invalidation created by the Lambda function
Common Permission Errors in AWS
This is a very common pattern in AWS:
Service A	Needs Permission	To Do	On Service B
CodePipeline	lambda:InvokeFunction	Invoke	Lambda
Lambda	cloudfront:CreateInvalidation	Invalidate	CloudFront
CodePipeline	s3:PutObject	Store artifacts	S3
Lambda	logs:PutLogEvents	Write logs	CloudWatch
Your Understanding is Correct!
You were absolutely right:
•	✅ CloudFront doesn't execute Lambda
•	✅ Lambda has CloudFront permissions
•	✅ The missing piece is CodePipeline → Lambda permission
This is exactly the kind of AWS permission chain that trips up many developers. Each service needs permission to call the next service in the chain!
Add the 
lambda:InvokeFunction
 permission to your CodePipeline role, and your pipeline should work perfectly!



7.1 Initial Test
1.	Your pipeline should start automatically after creation
2.	Monitor progress in CodePipeline console
3.	Check your website after deployment
7.2 Test Automatic Deployment
1.	Make a change to your website files
2.	Commit and push:
git add .

git commit -m "Test automatic deployment"

git push origin main

Run in CloudShell
3.	Watch pipeline trigger automatically
4.	Verify changes on your CloudFront URL: 
d1h5qajn6cztrt.cloudfront.net
Your Complete CI/CD Flow
GitHub Push → CodePipeline → (CodeBuild) → S3 Deploy → CloudFront Invalidation

     ↓              ↓            ↓           ↓              ↓

  Triggers      Pulls Code    Builds      Updates       Clears Cache

Expected Costs
•	CodePipeline: $1/month per active pipeline
•	CodeBuild: ~$0.01 per build (minimal for static sites)
•	Lambda: Free tier covers invalidations
•	Total additional cost: ~$1-2/month
Your pipeline is now ready! Every push to your GitHub repository will automatically update your website and clear the CloudFront cache for immediate updates.

15.	        }
16.	    ]
17.	}
 
18.	Create policy
Step 2.4: Create API Gateway
1. Go to API Gateway Console
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-east-1

2. Create API
1.	Create API

2.	Fill out the form
3.	Submit and check your email

“Unknown error” created a contact-test.html form to debug
 

 

 

Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. The problem is that your Lambda function is receiving 
"httpMethod": "UNKNOWN"  instead of "POST"
. This indicates an API Gateway integration issue.
🎯 Root Cause: API Gateway Integration Problem
Your Lambda function is not receiving the HTTP method properly from API Gateway. This happens when the integration is not configured correctly.
✅ Solution: Fix API Gateway Integration
Step 1: Check Current Integration Type
1.	Go to API Gateway Console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-east-1 
2.	Click your API: portfolio-contact-api
3.	Resources → Click on /contact
 → Click on POST
4.	Click on "Integration Request"
Step 2: Fix Integration Configuration
You should see:
•	Integration type: Lambda Function
•	Use Lambda Proxy integration: ✅ This should be CHECKED
If "Use Lambda Proxy integration" is NOT checked:
1.	Click "Integration Request"
2.	Check the box: ✅ Use Lambda Proxy integration
3.	Save
4.	Deploy API (Actions → Deploy API → Stage: prod)
Step 3: Alternative - Recreate the Integration
If the proxy integration is already enabled, let's recreate it:
1.	Click on POST method → Actions → Delete Method → Delete
2.	Create Method again:
o	Select: POST
 → ✓ checkmark
o	Integration type: 
Lambda Function
o	Use Lambda Proxy integration: ✅ CHECKED
o	Lambda Region: us-east-1
o	Lambda Function: portfolio-contact-form
o	Save
o	Add Permission to Lambda Function: OK
Step 4: Redeploy API
1.	Actions → Deploy API
2.	Deployment stage: prod
3.	Deploy
Step 5: Test the Fix
1.	Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2.	Try your contact-test.html again
3.	Should now work correctly
🔍 Why This Happened
Without Lambda Proxy Integration:
{

  "name": "Test User",

  "email": "test@example.com"

}

Lambda receives: Direct JSON object (no HTTP context)
With Lambda Proxy Integration:
{

  "httpMethod": "POST",

  "headers": {...},

  "body": "{\"name\":\"Test User\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\"}",

  "isBase64Encoded": false

}

Lambda receives: Full HTTP request context
🚀 Quick Verification Steps
Step 1: Test API Gateway Directly
1.	API Gateway Console → POST method → TEST
2.	Request Body:
3.	{
4.	    "name": "Test User",
5.	    "email": "mhussain.myindia@gmail.com",
6.	    "message": "Test message"
7.	}

 

 

Email id is case sensitive in lambda, otherwise it will show not verified

Log says email send but did not receive it for outlook.com, but gmail is working.

8.	Test
9.	Should return: Success response (not 405 error)

Test is working but not the form submission, it says unknown method

Here are several ways to test your Lambda function:
1. AWS Lambda Console Test
Create test event in Lambda console:
{
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "body": "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\",\"subject\":\"Test\",\"message\":\"Hello world\"}",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "isBase64Encoded": false
}
Copyjson

 




To test through API gateway

To test through the API Gateway console:
1. API Gateway Console Test
1.	Go to API Gateway console
2.	Find your API (the one connected to your Lambda)
3.	Navigate to your resource/method (POST /contact)
4.	Click "TEST" button
5.	Fill in the test form:
Method: POST
Request Body:


{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "mhussain.myindia@gmail.com",
  "subject": "API Gateway Test",
  "message": "Testing through API Gateway console"
}
 

Contact-test.html is working now, but not sure which one fixed the issues,

What Fixed It:
1.	Lambda Proxy Integration was enabled (either recently or took time to propagate)
2.	API was redeployed to project1-prod stage
3.	Propagation completed across all AWS edge locations


Root Cause Analysis

Removing API setting “Lambda Integration” gives below error
 
Non Proxy Lambda should work with below change in lambda
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Non-proxy format - just return the data
    return {
        "success": True,
        "message": "Email sent successfully"
    }

Why Lambda Proxy Integration is Better
Advantages:
1.	✅ Full HTTP control - status codes, headers, CORS
2.	✅ No response mapping needed
3.	✅ Access to all request data - headers, query params, etc.
4.	✅ Easier debugging - see exact HTTP request/response
5.	✅ Industry standard - most tutorials use this
Disadvantages of Non-Proxy:
1.	❌ Complex setup - need response mapping
2.	❌ Limited HTTP control - harder to set headers
3.	❌ Less request data - no headers, limited context
4.	❌ More configuration - prone to errors
🔍 Complete Comparison
Lambda Proxy Integration (Recommended)
def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Full HTTP request available

    method = event['httpMethod']  # "POST"

    headers = event['headers']    # All headers

    body = event['body']          # Request body as string

    

    # Return HTTP response format

    return {

        'statusCode': 200,

        'headers': {

            'Content-Type': 'application/json',

            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'

        },

        'body': json.dumps({

            'success': True,

            'message': 'Success!'

        })

    }

Non-Proxy Integration (Complex)
def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Limited request data

    name = event['name']      # Direct field access

    email = event['email']    # No headers available

    

    # Return simple data (API Gateway maps to HTTP)

    return {

        'success': True,

        'message': 'Success!'

    }

📋 Troubleshooting Guide
Error: "Failed to fetch"
Cause: Non-proxy integration without proper response mapping Fix: Enable Lambda Proxy Integration
Error: "Method UNKNOWN not allowed"
Cause: Proxy integration enabled but method detection issue Fix: Check API Gateway method configuration and redeploy
Error: CORS issues
Cause: Missing CORS headers Fix: Add proper CORS headers in Lambda response
Error: "Invalid JSON"
Cause: Lambda returning wrong response format Fix: Ensure proper 
statusCode
, 
headers
, 
body
 format
🎯 Best Practice Recommendation
Always use Lambda Proxy Integration because:
1.	✅ Simpler setup - no response mapping needed
2.	✅ Full HTTP control - complete request/response handling
3.	✅ Better debugging - see exact HTTP flow
4.	✅ Industry standard - matches most documentation
5.	✅ Future-proof - supports all HTTP features
The "Failed to fetch" error confirms that Lambda Proxy Integration is essential for proper API Gateway + Lambda integration in modern web applications.
Your observation perfectly demonstrates why proxy integration is the recommended approach!



What Most Likely Happened:
1. API Gateway Deployment Propagation Delay
•	Your API Gateway had a recent deployment on September 27, 2025 at 22:26:04 UTC
•	API Gateway changes can take 5-15 minutes to fully propagate across all edge locations
•	During this propagation period, some requests hit old configuration (causing "UNKNOWN" method)
•	Others hit new configuration (working correctly)
2. CloudFront/Edge Caching
•	Your website is served through CloudFront
•	CloudFront caches API responses and configurations
•	Cache invalidation can take time to propagate globally
•	Old cached responses were returning the "UNKNOWN" error
3. DNS Propagation
•	API Gateway endpoint DNS changes can take time to propagate
•	Some DNS servers were still pointing to old API configuration
🎯 The Exact Root Cause
API Gateway Integration Configuration Issue:
Before (Broken):
API Gateway POST method → Non-Proxy Integration → Lambda

Event: {"name": "...", "email": "...", httpMethod: "UNKNOWN"}

After (Fixed):
API Gateway POST method → Lambda Proxy Integration → Lambda  

Event: {"httpMethod": "POST", "body": "{\"name\":\"...\"}", "headers": {...}}

What Fixed It:
1.	Lambda Proxy Integration was enabled (either recently or took time to propagate)
2.	API was redeployed to project1-prod stage
3.	Propagation completed across all AWS edge locations
🔍 Why "You Did Nothing" But It Fixed Itself
AWS Service Propagation Timeline:
•	0-2 minutes: API Gateway deployment completes
•	2-5 minutes: Regional propagation
•	5-15 minutes: Global edge location propagation
•	15-30 minutes: Full DNS and cache propagation
Your issue resolved during this propagation window.
🛠️ How to Prevent This in Future
1. Always Deploy After Changes
# After making API Gateway changes:

Actions → Deploy API → Select Stage → Deploy

Run in CloudShell
2. Wait for Propagation
•	Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment before testing
•	Test from different locations/networks to verify propagation
3. Check Integration Settings
Always verify:
•	✅ Lambda Proxy Integration is enabled
•	✅ CORS is properly configured
•	✅ Method Response includes proper status codes
4. Use Deployment Stages Properly
dev → test → prod

Test in dev/test stages before deploying to prod
5. Monitor CloudWatch Logs
# Check Lambda logs for httpMethod values:

aws logs filter-log-events \

  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/project1-portfolio-contact-form \

  --filter-pattern "httpMethod"

Run in CloudShell
🔍 Debugging Checklist for Future
When API Gateway Issues Occur:
1. Check Integration Type
API Gateway → Method → Integration Request → Lambda Proxy Integration

2. Check Recent Deployments
API Gateway → Stages → Deployment History

3. Test API Gateway Directly
API Gateway → Method → TEST (bypasses caching)

4. Check Lambda Logs
CloudWatch → Log Groups → /aws/lambda/function-name

5. Wait for Propagation
Wait 10-15 minutes after any API Gateway changes

🎯 Key Lessons
1. AWS Propagation Takes Time
•	API Gateway changes: 5-15 minutes
•	CloudFront invalidation: 10-20 minutes
•	DNS changes: Up to 48 hours (but usually minutes)
2. Lambda Proxy Integration is Critical
•	Without it: 
httpMethod: "UNKNOWN"
•	With it: 
httpMethod: "POST"
3. Always Deploy After Changes
•	Changes in console don't take effect until deployed
•	Each stage needs separate deployment
4. Test Systematically
•	API Gateway TEST (bypasses all caching)
•	Direct API call (bypasses CloudFront)
•	Full website test (includes all layers)
📋 Future Troubleshooting Steps
When you encounter similar issues:
1.	✅ Check if Lambda Proxy Integration is enabled
2.	✅ Deploy API to correct stage
3.	✅ Wait 10-15 minutes for propagation
4.	✅ Test API Gateway directly first
5.	✅ Check CloudWatch logs for event structure
6.	✅ Clear browser cache and try different network
The root cause was most likely a combination of:
•	Recent API Gateway deployment still propagating
•	Lambda Proxy Integration configuration taking effect
•	Edge location caching serving old responses
This is a very common AWS issue - services are eventually consistent, and changes take time to propagate globally.

contact
o	Enable CORS: ✅
3.	Create POST method:
o	Integration type: Lambda Function
o	Lambda Proxy integration: ✅ ENABLED
o	Function: 
portfolio-contact-form
4.	Enable CORS:
o	Actions → Enable CORS
o	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 
*
o	Methods: 
POST,OPTIONS
5.	Deploy:
o	Actions → Deploy API
o	Stage: 
prod
6.	Update your HTML with the new API URL
🎯 Expected Result After Fix
Your debug log should show:
[timestamp] Response status: 200

[timestamp] Raw response: {"success": true, "message": "Thank you for your message! I will get back to you soon.", "debug": {...}}

[timestamp] SUCCESS: Message sent successfully

Try fixing the Lambda Proxy integration first, then test your contact form again. This should resolve the "Method UNKNOWN" issue!

STEP 5: Security Headers with CloudFront Functions ($0.10/month)
Step 5.1: Create CloudFront Function
1. Go to CloudFront Console
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home

2. Create Function
1.	Functions → Create function
2.	Function name: security-headers
3.	Description: Add security headers to responses
4.	Create function
arn:aws:cloudfront::206055866143:function/project1-security-headers-function

3. Add Function Code
Replace the default code with:
 

4. Test Function
1.	Test tab
2.	Event type:  viewer-response
3.	Test event:
 
4.	Test function
5.	Verify security headers are added in the output

Perfect! The CloudFront function test response shows that all security headers are being added correctly:
✅ Security Headers Added:
1.	strict-transport-security
 - Forces HTTPS for 1 year
2.	content-security-policy
 - Prevents XSS attacks with proper source restrictions
3.	x-content-type-options: nosniff
 - Prevents MIME sniffing
4.	x-frame-options: DENY
 - Blocks clickjacking
5.	x-xss-protection
 - Enables browser XSS protection
6.	referrer-policy
 - Controls referrer information
7.	permissions-policy
 - Disables unnecessary browser features
✅ Performance Header:
•	cache-control: public, max-age=31536000
 - Caches static content for 1 year
✅ Original Headers Preserved:
•	content-type
 - Original response header maintained
The CloudFront function is working perfectly! It's adding comprehensive security headers while preserving the original response. This will protect your website from common web vulnerabilities when deployed.
Next step: Deploy this function to your CloudFront distribution to apply these security headers to all responses.
